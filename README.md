# Frontend Coding Challenge

## What did I do?

Thank you for allowing me to participate in the front-end coding challenge. I'm unfamiliar with VueJS, particularly version 3, which was recently released with many changes, and I may have made design mistakes in my code. I would greatly appreciate it if you could provide feedback on the code. I included inline documentation for each module and wrote unit test cases for the modules in the project. However, some of the tests may fail as some of the configurations for jest may not be set up correctly. I tried to test every scenario to ensure full functionality individually.

## What could I do?

Given more time, I would strive to improve the watchlist page by fixing the bug and optimizing its performance. I would also enhance the current testing framework by adding end-to-end test scenarios and repairing the existing configuration issues. Finally, I would add some animations to improve the overall look and feel of the design, making it more interactive and visually appealing.

## Q&A

1. What happens in case the WebSocket disconnects? How would you go further to keep
   the live data available or inform the user? Please discuss the challenges.

   > In case of WebSocket disconnects, the server and client lose their connection. The client-side WebSocket API typically provides events to handle this situation, such as "close" or "error". One way to maintain access to live data is to periodically attempt to reconnect and then restart the data transfer once the connection is re-established.</br>
   > Another approach could be to switch to a different communication mechanism, such as long polling, to keep the data flow going until the WebSocket connection can be re-established. This can be particularly effective in systems where real-time data delivery is critical due to low latency.</br>
   > Informing the user about the disconnection can be done through notifications or error messages displayed on the UI. The challenge here is to provide a clear and concise message to the user about the situation and what actions they need to take if any.</br>
   > Maintaining the availability of real-time data despite disconnections presents a significant challenge that requires meticulous planning and execution to minimize data loss and preserve the user experience.

2. What happens if a user adds an instrument multiple times to their list? Please discuss possible challenges and mitigations.

   > One way to minimize the occurrence of duplicated data is to implement a filtering system that eliminates duplicates before the system checks for duplicates before presenting the data to the user. A method to eliminate A system that verifies the uniqueness of data before allowing it to be added can minimize the effects of duplicate data. However, if the user bypasses these checks and adds the same data multiple times, the filtering process described above can help ensure that the data is presented clearly and organized. The system can minimize data loss by verifying the uniqueness of the data and storing only one instance of it. Whenever changes are made, the system updates the single instance. Additionally, it can improve the overall user experience, as the user will not be confused by seeing the same data multiple times on their list.

3. What potential performance issues might you face when this app scales with multiple subscriptions? How would you improve the speed and user experience?

   > To tackle the performance degradation issue as the app scales with multiple subscriptions, it's essential to properly manage the frequency and amount of data received from the socket. A system can be established to improve speed and user experience by limiting the data received to a specific time frame. And implements a short delay between each update. Reducing the load on the design and preventing lag can be achieved by implementing this system.</br>
   > Additionally, updating the live data every millisecond as the app scales can result in sluggishness and a bad user experience. The constant flow of data can slow down the UI, leading to delays and frustration for the user. One approach to mitigate this issue is to create a system that can efficiently handle multiple subscriptions while still providing real-time updates to the user.</br>
   > It's essential to remember that adding multiple instances of different instruments to the current system may affect its performance. The unsubscribe button may not function as expected in every render due to the constant updating of data within each card. Improving the overall speed and user experience will require careful consideration of the system's architecture and implementation.

Hello there, thanks again for your interest in Trade Republic. To kick off the
interview process we have prepared a short coding exercise for you, to demonstrate your knowledge of the language and tools we use to develop our web applications.

**Please note: The coding test should show that you feel comfortable working with any JavaScript framework. We use Vue.js and prefer it but you can use another framework if you feel that it will better show off your skills. The assessment of your submission will not change if you use a different framework.**

In case you have any questions, feel free to reach out to your dedicated recruiter.

## Context

Developing our app, we work with a REST API as well as real-time streaming market
data to display the latest stock prices with millisecond latency. You should feel
comfortable developing an app to address these two types of network interaction. The WebSocket server youâ€™ll be using accepts and emits messages in JSON format.

## Things we care for:

âœ… Unit tests

âœ… Semantic HTML

âœ… Responsive Design

âœ… Documentation

âœ… Accessibility

## Nice to have:

ðŸ¤© Use of Reactive programming libraries like RxJS.

### Glossary

We donâ€™t expect you to be a trading expert and some of the terms are quite specific to the space. Hereâ€™s some of the terms we use in the task:
| Term | Definition |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ISIN` | The 12-digit alphanumeric code that uniquely identifies a specific instrument |
| `instrument` | A tradable asset, or a negotiable item, such as a security, commodity, derivative, or index, or any item that underlies a derivative. |
| `bid` | The highest price a buyer will pay to buy a specified number of shares of an instrument at any given time. |
| `ask` | The lowest price at which a seller will sell the instrument. |

## The Application

In the interest of saving you some time, we provided a working [Vue](https://vuejs.org) application. This application also includes a small set of components for you to use. Please note, using these components is optional, you are welcome to change them in any way you want, you should only submit something you are comfortable with.

## Using this application

### Pre-requisites

Please make sure to have [Node](https://nodejs.org) 16 installed.

### Running the code

Once you have unzipped the folder and are ready to start, you can run `yarn` (or `npm install`) to install dependencies. After that, you can run:

```bash
# npm
npm run dev

# or yarn
yarn dev
```

This will start the application in development mode. It will also start the WebSocket server on port 8425.

You can see the client application running in your browser by going to http://localhost:3000.

## Task Description

In this repository we have provided you with a minimal [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org) + [Vite](https://vitejs.dev) application. Your task is to extend this app so that it allows a user to subscribe/unsubscribe to a list of stocks. The user should be able to subscribe to a stock by entering its [ISIN](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/isin.asp) number into an input and then see the current price of the stock displayed in a list view.

What we would like to see is clean, readable code that you would be **comfortable submitting to your colleagues for review**. Please explain decisions that youâ€™ve made and what you would do if you had more time to continue development. You can add them to this `README.md` file.

Requirements:

- We want to see how you interpret [user stories](#user-stories) into a solution, please fulfill all of the stories provided.
- Please avoid using a UI library, we want to be able to see your styling skills.
- We recommend using Vue but you can use a different framework if you feel that youâ€™ll be able to demonstrate your skills better.
- Great user experience is important to us at Trade Republic. Please approach the challenge from a userâ€™s perspective and build something you would be happy to put into userâ€™s hands.
- Please also provide setup instructions and answer the following [questions](#questions) in your README.

## Tasks

### Task 1

Create a form that allows a user to submit an ISIN and add it to a watch list.

#### User Stories

> As a user, I should be able to submit an ISIN and it should be added to my watch list.

> As a user, I should not be able to subscribe to the same ISIN twice so that I donâ€™t get confused by seeing multiple versions of the same stock.

> As a user, I should not be able to subscribe to an empty or invalid ISIN.

> Validation rules: An ISIN is a 12-character alphanumeric code. It consists of three parts: A two letter country code, a nine character alpha-numeric national security identifier, and a single check digit.
> Example:- US0378331005.

### Task 2

Create the UI and render the watch list created in the previous task to the DOM.

#### User Stories

> As a user, I should be able to view a list of my subscribed stocks displaying the latest stock price received from the WebSocket connection so that I can keep track of multiple stocks at the same time.

> As a user, I should be able to unsubscribe from a stock thatâ€™s in my watch list so that I can focus on the stocks Iâ€™m interested in.

> As a user, I should be notified if the websocket disconnects and the data is not up to date so that I know that the price is not accurate.

> As a user, I should be able to view their stocks on desktop and mobile screen widths so that I am able to use the app on my mobile browser.

### Task 3

At this point, you can consider the challenge to be complete.

This task is intentionally left open for you to add any feature you want to the application. Anything is valid, from improvements to Accessibility all the way to UI Transitions, CSS, etc.

## Socket Reference

The WebSocket server is started when you run `yarn dev`. You can then connect to it at

```URL
ws://localhost:8425/
```

To subcribe to a specific security

```JSON
{
    "subscribe": "${ISIN}"
}
```

To unsubscribe to a specific security

```JSON
{
    "unsubscribe": "${ISIN}"
}
```

#### Example Request

To subscribe to the BASF instrument you would use

```JSON
{
    "subscribe": "DE000BASF111"
}
```

#### Sample Response

You would then receive a WebSocket stream with messages in the following format

```JSON
{
    "isin": "DE000BASF111",
    "price": 11.316359370403822,
    "bid": 11.306359370403822,
    "ask": 11.326359370403821
}
```
